    <!-- Below is the starter code for my Portfolio
    that is to be hosted on github pages.
    It will likely have various updates - this is only the beginning.
    I would like to end up creating a portfolio page 
    with the following content sections:
    about me
    qualifications
    skills
    projects (and/or links to projects)
    contact

    My goal will be to try to create a landing page that is:
    1. visually appealing (and includes content animaiton)
    2. easy to navigate
    3. informative
    4. professional looking
    5. responsive
    6. accessible
    7. interactive
    8. engaging
    9. easy to maintain
    10 has good load times

    I am hoping to do this by combining what I have learned in my diploma
    with what I am learning now in my bootcamp = so ideally a 
    site build that includes: 
    
    html, css, js, figma, lottie file 
    
    built from scracth
